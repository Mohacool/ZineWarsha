                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To understand what Zellige (also, Zillij or Zellij) is, it is important to understand what the art of mosaic is and the distinction between the two. Mosaics have a very rich history dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE in Mesopotamia, where the first evidence of mosaics can be found.<sup>1</sup>Independently of Mesopotamia, the tradition of mosaic appears in Ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE, before making its way to the Romans and Byzantines.<sup>2</sup>

              Zellige (also, Zillij or Zellij) is a mesmerizing art that decorated mosques, madrassas, and palaces across Morocco and the Spanish peninsula in the 10th to 14th Centuries. It is a tilework technique that uses glazed clay tiles cut and arranged in mathematical tessellations to ornament surfaces. Still practiced today in parts of Morocco, the rich history of the art is at risk of slowly fading away. The word Zellige (زليج) derives from the Arabic word ‘zalaj’ (زَلَجَ) meaning “slippery, smooth, or to slide”. Zellige is related, but not equivalent, to mosaic, which has a very rich history dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE in Mesopotamia.<sup>1</sup> The mosaic tradition appears independently in Ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE, before making its way to the Roman and Byzantine empires, where it reaches its peak between the 4th and 14th centuries CE.<sup>2</sup>

            <span class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;The Great Mosque of Damascus, also known as the Umayyad Mosque, was completed in 714/715 CE, and to this day, is one of the oldest surviving congregational mosques in the world.<sup>4</sup> Damascus was a melting pot of cultures, and the rich history of the mosques site reflects it. To the East once stood a Roman Temple to Jupiter, whose remains survive today. It had been a temple to the Greek God Zeus, and a temple to the Canaanite God Hadad before that, and it even briefly existed as a Christian Cathedral when it was converted in 391 CE.<sup>5</sup> Thus, it comes as no surprise that this culturally rich site saw the birth of the first Islamic mosaics.

              &emsp;&emsp;Immediately upon entering the courtyard of the Umayyad mosque, a large mosaic announces its presence. Sitting above the main entrance, the mosaic depicts architecture and natural landscaped full of lush trees. The contents of the mosaic are debated amongst scholars, with some suggesting that it portrays the gardens of Paradise, and others suggesting that it depicts the natural landscapes of Damascus. <sup>6</sup> Influenced by Byzantine mosaics, the scenes are rendered in vibrant green, blue, and gold tesserae. One notable difference is the lack of figural representation in the mosaic at Damascus, which is common in Islamic art. Similar mosaics once adorned the prayer hall, amounting to over an acre of mosaic, but the vast majority do not survive today. <sup>7</sup>             </span>

            <span class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;Where did the craftsmen for these ambitious mosaics come from? There is no definitive answer to this question, but given the grandeur of the project, they would likely have come from all across the Umayyad caliphate, including Persia, Egypt, India, and notably Morocco. It is believed that the Byzantine emperor sent mosaicists from Constantinople, though some scholars contest him doing so.<sup>8</sup> Regardless, it is certain that the craftsmen were experienced mosaicists, who had worked on the Byzantine mosaics of Constantinople, and the Greco-Roman mosaics of Egypt. Now in Damascus, they were working to create a new form: the aniconic Islamic mosaic.             </span>

            <span  class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;Almost immediately, the influence of the mosque and its mosaics was felt across the Umayyad caliphate, quickly becoming the standard reference for Umayyad architecture. Shortly after the mosque was completed, the Umayyad dynasty fell to the Abbasids in 750 CE. <sup>9</sup> Under the rule of Abd al-Rahman, the Umayyads founded a new Emirate in Al Andalous (modern day Spain, Portugal, and parts of Morocco) which would come to be known as the Caliphate of Cordoba. <sup>10</sup> It is in Cordoba that one of the most prominent examples of the Damascus Mosques influence can be seen.

            <span class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;The great mosque-cathedral of Cordoba, converted into a mosque in 785 CE,<sup>12</sup> shares much with the Great Mosque of Damascus. It too was sited on the remains of a Roman Temple which was converted to a cathedral, before becoming a mosque. <sup>11</sup> Their most important similarity is the appearance of one of the first Spanish Muslim mosaics, as seen in the Mihrab of the mosque. It is likely that some of the mosaicists who worked on the Damascus mosque would have worked on the mosque in Cordoba, and through them, the tradition of mosaic found its footing in the newly founded caliphate. It’s fascinating to think of the rich cultural web that was developing as the craft and its knowledge percolated between cities, architectures, and people.            </span>

            <br><br>
            <span  class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;It is believed that the first Zellige tiles were created in Morocco in the 10th Century CE, though this was not well documented. <sup></sup> Zellige was the offspring of mosaic, and eventually evolved into its own art form. No longer using Byzantine tesserae made of marble and stone, Zellige craftsmen created tiles out of clay, which was abundant in high quality in Morocco. They glazed, hand cut and arranged the tiles into mathematical geometries.             <br>
            </span>
            
            <span class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;Zellige quickly became prominent and spread across the Spanish peninsula. Through the following dynasties, the art of Zellige grew in stature, and emerged all across Morocco, Spain and Portugal, in Mosques, Madrassas, and palaces, such as the Alhambra in Spain. 
            </span>
            <br>
            <span class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;Unlike the Islamic mosaics of Cordoba and Damascus, Zellige did not depict scenery, nor architecture. Instead, it pushed the non-figural traditions of the Islamic mosaic even further, stripping them down to pure decoration – pure ornament. Zellige tiles were designed and arranged by skilled masters to create mathematical geometries and tessellations, favoring the abstract over the representational. As metaphysician Titus Burckhardt says, to the artisan, these geometries symbolized the Indivisible Unity of God and the Universe, a “Unity in Multiplicity”. <sup>14</sup>

            <br><br>
            <span  class="body_text">
              &emsp;&emsp;The intense cultural cross pollination of the 4th and 14th centuries, coupled with the difficulty to date mosaics and Zellige makes it near impossible to track down a single thread of origin for much of this mesmerizing art form; perhaps because no single thread exists. Today, even from a secular view, the stunning geometries, colors, and tessellations of Zellige invoke a sense of the sympathy of things. In the art of Zellige, the act of creation is an act of faith; the ego disappears and only ornament is left. It is a recognition of eternality, unity and interconnectedness. Almost as though an embodiment of the rich cultural connectedness which birthed it.
