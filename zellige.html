              Zellige (also, Zillij or Zellij) is a mesmerizing art that decorated mosques, madrassas, and palaces across Morocco and the Spanish peninsula in the 10th to 14th Centuries. It is a tilework technique that uses glazed clay tiles cut and arranged in mathematical tessellations to ornament surfaces. Still practiced today in parts of Morocco, the rich history of the art is at risk of slowly fading away. The word Zellige (زليج) derives from the Arabic word ‘zalaj’ (زَلَجَ) meaning “slippery, smooth, or to slide”. Zellige is related, but not equivalent, to mosaic, which has a very rich history dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE in Mesopotamia.<sup>1</sup> The mosaic tradition appears independently in Ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE, before making its way to the Roman and Byzantine empires, where it reaches its peak between the 4th and 14th centuries CE.<sup>2</sup>

                Also known as the Umayyad Mosque, completed in 714/715 CE, is one of the earliest surviving congregational mosques in the world.<sup>5</sup> Damascus was a melting pot of cultures, and the site of the mosque reflects it. To the East existed a Roman Temple to Jupiter, whose remains survive today. It had been a temple to Zeus prior to Roman invasion, and a temple to the God Hadad prior to that.<sup>6</sup> This same temple was converted into a Christian Cathedral in 391 CE, though the exact location of the cathedral is unknown.<sup>7</sup> It comes as no surprise that this same melting pot was the starting point of Islamic mosaics.
                Immediately upon entering the courtyard, the large mosaic announces its presence.

                Sitting above the main entrance, the scenes depict architecture and a natural landscape full of lush trees. The specific content is debated amongst scholars, with some suggesting it is a portrayal of the gardens of Paradise, and others suggesting it is a depiction of the natural landscapes of Damascus.<sup>8</sup> Influenced by the Byzantine mosaics, the scenes are rendered in vibrant green, blue, and gold tesserae. The notable difference being a lack of figural representation as is commonly the case in Islamic art. Similar mosaics existed inside the prayer hall, amounting to over an acre of mosaic, but the vast majority do not survive today.<sup>9</sup>
