                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To understand what Zellige (also, Zillij or Zellij) is, it is important to understand what the art of mosaic is and the distinction between the two. Mosaics have a very rich history dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE in Mesopotamia, where the first evidence of mosaics can be found.<sup>1</sup>Independently of Mesopotamia, the tradition of mosaic appears in Ancient Greece in the 5th century BCE, before making its way to the Romans and Byzantines.<sup>2</sup>

            It is in Byzantium between the 4th and 14th centuries CE that the art of mosaic reaches its peak.<sup>3</sup> Stunning mosaics began to appear in many churches and cathedrals across Byzantium, quickly surpassing the techniques of their predecessors.<sup>4</sup> This surging art form naturally found its way to the Arabs via the Levant, where one of the first examples of Muslim Arab mosaics are found

                Also known as the Umayyad Mosque, completed in 714/715 CE, is one of the earliest surviving congregational mosques in the world.<sup>5</sup> Damascus was a melting pot of cultures, and the site of the mosque reflects it. To the East existed a Roman Temple to Jupiter, whose remains survive today. It had been a temple to Zeus prior to Roman invasion, and a temple to the God Hadad prior to that.<sup>6</sup> This same temple was converted into a Christian Cathedral in 391 CE, though the exact location of the cathedral is unknown.<sup>7</sup> It comes as no surprise that this same melting pot was the starting point of Islamic mosaics.
                Immediately upon entering the courtyard, the large mosaic announces its presence.

                Sitting above the main entrance, the scenes depict architecture and a natural landscape full of lush trees. The specific content is debated amongst scholars, with some suggesting it is a portrayal of the gardens of Paradise, and others suggesting it is a depiction of the natural landscapes of Damascus.<sup>8</sup> Influenced by the Byzantine mosaics, the scenes are rendered in vibrant green, blue, and gold tesserae. The notable difference being a lack of figural representation as is commonly the case in Islamic art. Similar mosaics existed inside the prayer hall, amounting to over an acre of mosaic, but the vast majority do not survive today.<sup>9</sup>
